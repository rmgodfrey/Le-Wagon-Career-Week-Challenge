A solution to a sample technical challenge for back-end developers. The brief was to develop “a small Ruby on Rails application providing an endpoint which takes a GPS latitude and longitude and spits out the names of museums around that location grouped by their postcode as JSON,” using Mapbox’s Geocoding API. My solution actually works not just for museums, but for other places of interest as well. For example, if you make a GET request to `/museums?lat=52.494857&lng=13.437641`, you will get a list of nearby museums grouped by postcode, but if you replace `museums` with `beaches`, you will get a list of nearby beaches, and if you replace it with `bars`, you will get a list of nearby bars, etc.
